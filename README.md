# Set-Phishing-Simulations

This repository documents phishing simulation activities using the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET). It serves as a guide for security professionals, 

penetration testers, and organizations to conduct controlled phishing tests and improve their defense mechanisms. The repository covers key aspects of 

phishing simulation, from setting up phishing pages to analyzing captured credentials, and provides recommendations for mitigating social engineering threats.

🔍 Key Features

🔹 Configuring and Hosting Phishing Pages

📌 Step-by-step instructions on how to set up and host realistic phishing pages using SET.

🛠️ Guidance on selecting and customizing attack vectors (e.g., credential harvesting).

🔹 Simulating Credential Harvesting

📋 Detailed process for simulating credential collection during phishing attacks.

🔐 Tracks usernames and passwords captured from phishing attempts.

🔹 Analyzing Captured Credentials

📊 Methodologies for reviewing and analyzing collected data to evaluate attack effectiveness.

💻 Techniques for monitoring credential capture logs in real-time.

🛡️ Best Practices and Recommendations

🔸 User Awareness and Training

💡 Educate employees about phishing risks, tactics, and how to recognize suspicious communications.

📚 Conduct regular phishing awareness training to minimize successful attacks.

🔸 Email Security and Filtering

🛠️ Implement email filtering solutions to identify and block phishing attempts.

🔑 Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) on sensitive accounts to mitigate credential theft.

🔸 Regular Security Audits and Simulations

🔄 Periodically run phishing simulations to test employee responses and readiness.

📑 Perform regular security audits and update protocols based on new threats.

🌐 Awareness and Resilience

The repository aims to raise awareness about the prevalence of phishing attacks and promote cybersecurity resilience across organizations.

By utilizing SET for controlled phishing simulations, organizations can better understand their vulnerabilities and improve security policies.
